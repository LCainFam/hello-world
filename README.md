# hello-world
This is my newbie repository for learning from JavaScript code samples
My first course is from the book Head First JavaScript Programming and its related GitHub code samples.
I plan to learn either React.js or Ember.js in my initial efforts to eventually develop single-page web apps.

I'm a retired Mechanical Engineer with experience ranging from sales and marketing of computer and software solutions for business to Corporate Engineering in areas of manufacturing and headquarters operations. I started dabbling with desktop web applications using many of the simpler technologies of the Year 2000 era. Since I had supervised the IT department along with engineering and maintenance departments in a past job, I became interested in knowing more about Network Management and became Windows NT certified in 2000.  So now, with way too much time and many unfulfilled dreams in developing single-page web apps for so many of the struggles experienced throughout my career, I want to learn more and create some solutions.  The journey starts anew!
